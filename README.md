    "reviewers": [ "username1", "username2" ],
    "browser": true,                   // Optional. If set, the PRs will open in the browser in the end
    "repositories": [
       {
          "owner": "MyName_Or_Company",
          "name": "MyCoolRepo",
          "defaultBase": "master",     // Optional (default = none)

       }
   ]
 }
```
