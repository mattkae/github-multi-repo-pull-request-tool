# Github Multi Repo Pull Request Tool

## Purpose
Create pull requests in multiple repositories and link them to one another.

## Features
- Create pull requests for multiple repositories
- Link those pull requests between one another via keywords
- Make those pull requests have the same body, title, and ticket reference
- Add a trusted set of reviewers to those pull requests automatically

## Requirements
node 12+

## Usage
When you want to open a cross-repo pull request, you will do the following:

1. Update `content.md` file with the body of the pull request. This markdown file can include a few keywords to automatically fill in the blanks for you:
   - **$TITLE**: Creates an `h1` in your markdown containing the title specified in your `config.json`
   - **$FIXES**: Create an `h2` section containing the ticket number that was fixed by your work
   - **$MERGE_WITH**: Creates an `h2` section containing links to the repositories that will be merge with this pull request
   
2. Create file `config.json` at the root like so:
```ts
{
  "pat": string,            // Github personal access token
  "title": string,          // Title of the ticket
  "fixes"?: {
	  "repository": string, // Repository where the ticket lives
	  "issue": number       // Ticket number
  },
  "repositories": [
      {
		"owner": string,   // Owner of the repository
		"name": string,    // Name of the repository
		"head": string,    // Branch that your work is on
		"base": string,    // Branch that you are merging into
		disabled?: boolean // Specifies whether or not this repo should be ignored [default = false]
      }
  ]
}
```
The **title** and **fixes** fields are bound to change between runs. Also, you may want to **disable** certain repositories depending on whether they are being used for that particular pull request.

3. Install dependencies and run
```sh
npm install
npm run start
```
